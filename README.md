# robot-grisp-interrupt
simulate a robot with grisp moving around three positions. Firstly, the servo moves to guarantee 0 degrees. Then a random position between 1 and 3 is chosen and it goes from pos1 to posx
After that it moves according to the button p1, p2, p3. Here I simulated the positions with angles (p1 = 0, p2 = 90, p3 - 180) degrees
